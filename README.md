## About Me
I‚Äôm a developer who builds with purpose. Whether it's a trading algorithm that interacts with live forex markets, a TTRPG character engine built from scratch, or a full-stack AI-enhanced dashboard, every project I create is rooted in curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of what I can do with software.

My core expertise lies in Java, JavaScript, and backend system design. I‚Äôve engineered full-stack web applications, integrated real-time APIs, deployed machine learning models into live trading platforms, and worked with decentralized technologies like IPFS and Solidity. I value clarity, resilience, and craftsmanship in code... and I‚Äôm constantly leveling up.

I'm deeply motivated by tough problems, underserved communities, and overlooked opportunities. Right now, I‚Äôm focused on building software that feels responsive, intentional, and empowering - the kinda tools that people "want" to use.
